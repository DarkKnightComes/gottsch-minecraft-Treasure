  Who doesn't like finding <b>loot</b>?  It is always fun to find <b>free stuff</b>!
</p>

<b>Treasure2!</b> adds to the thrill of discovery in Minecraft. This mod adds various new and rare <b>chests of treasure</b> to be discovered. The chests are secured by a various assortment of <b>locks</b> and can only be unlocked by finding the corresponding <b>keys</b>.

# Development
Currently in **alpha** stage.

### I am inviting modelers to contribute new and interesting chest designs. They don't need to be the vanilla chest shape or size. However, there are a few rules to keep in mind as I do need to be able to add locks in a standardized way.  More on that later...

# Key and Locks
Hold the **Shift** key while using a key or a lock on a chest in order to use it.
